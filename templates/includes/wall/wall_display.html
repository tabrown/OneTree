I don't like the way the URLs are tied to this directory structure. We 
should find a way to tell the template system, "Hey, look in the directory
of the file that included the file you're looking for."

{% if errormsg %}
   <p class="wall-error-text">
     {{ errormsg }}
   </p>
{% endif %}

{% include "includes/wall/wall_submit.html" %}
<div class="wall">
<h2>wall posts</h2>
{% include "includes/wall/wall_content.html" %}
</div>
